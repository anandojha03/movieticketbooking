Certainly! If you prefer to develop the online movie ticket booking system as a monolithic application for now, we can proceed with that approach. The monolithic architecture is simpler to implement compared to microservices.

Here's a revised code structure for developing the monolithic application:

Monolithic Architecture Code Structure:
1. Package Structure:
   - `com.example.movieticketbooking`: Root package for the project.
   - `com.example.movieticketbooking.controllers`: Contains controllers for handling different requests.
   - `com.example.movieticketbooking.dao`: Data Access Object (DAO) classes for database operations.
   - `com.example.movieticketbooking.models`: Model classes representing entities in the system.
   - `com.example.movieticketbooking.services`: Contains service classes for business logic.
   - `com.example.movieticketbooking.utils`: Utility classes, such as validation, error handling, etc.

2. Model Classes:
   - `User`: Represents user details, including name, password, email, and phone number.
   - `Movie`: Represents movie details, such as name, language, duration, etc.
   - `Ticket`: Represents a booked ticket, including movie details, seat type, user information, etc.

3. DAO Classes:
   - `UserDAO`: Handles database operations related to users, such as user registration and authentication.
   - `MovieDAO`: Handles database operations related to movies, such as retrieving movie details and checking availability.
   - `TicketDAO`: Handles database operations related to ticket booking and cancellation.

4. Service Classes:
   - `UserService`: Contains methods for user registration, authentication, and business logic related to users.
   - `MovieService`: Contains methods for retrieving movie details, checking availability, etc.
   - `TicketService`: Contains methods for ticket booking, cancellation, and related business logic.

5. Controller Classes:
   - `RegistrationController`: Handles user registration requests.
   - `LoginController`: Handles user login requests and authentication.
   - `TicketBookingController`: Handles ticket booking requests and seat availability checks.
   - `TicketCancellationController`: Handles ticket cancellation requests.

6. Database Connection:
   - Use JDBC or an ORM framework like Hibernate to establish a connection with the MySQL database.
   - Create a `DatabaseUtil` class or configuration files to manage the database connection and provide utility methods for executing queries.

7. Exception Handling and Error Response:
   - Implement custom exception classes to handle specific errors.
   - Use exception handling mechanisms provided by the web framework to handle exceptions and provide appropriate error responses.

8. Security (Optional):
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as session-based authentication or JSON Web Tokens (JWT), for user login and access control.

9. Web Framework:
   - Choose a web framework like Spring MVC or Java Servlet API for handling request/response processing and managing sessions.

You can set up the necessary dependencies in your project using Maven or Gradle. Include dependencies like `spring-boot-starter-web` or the required servlet dependencies depending on the web framework you choose.

This code structure should give you a foundation for building the monolithic application. You can implement the necessary methods, logic, and database operations within the respective classes based on your specific requirements and the steps mentioned earlier.
